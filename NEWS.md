# autota 0.1.3

Changed "object not found" functionality so it only searches a number of popular packges for possible not-imported-symbols, as opposed to all installed packages.

# autota 0.1.0

The first version of the Auto TA has been released! It has support for 5 classes of errors:
* Syntax errors
* Could not find function
* Object not found
* Cannot open the connection
* Closure is not subsettable

And there's more to come. Happy coding!
